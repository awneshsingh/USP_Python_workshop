    "\n",
    "The easiest way to install ``runipy`` is with ``pip``:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip install runipy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command-line use\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a ``.ipynb`` file as a script, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ runipy MyNotebook.ipynb\n",

    "\n",
    "    $ runipy MyNotebook.ipynb OutputNotebook.ipynb\n",

    "    $ runipy MyNotebook.ipynb --html report.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passing Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pass arguments to the notebook through environment variables.\n",
    "The use of environment variables is OS- and shell- dependent, but in a\n",
    "typical UNIX-like environment they can be passed on the command line\n",
    "before the program name:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ myvar=value runipy MyNotebook.ipynb\n",

    "``environ`` is just a ``dict``, so you can use ``.get()`` to fall back\n",

    "\n",

    "    myvar = environ.get('myvar', 'default!')\n",

    "### Stdin / Stdout\n",
